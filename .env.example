# Dev vs production (recommended)
# ---------------------------------
# - .env.development.local  → used by "pnpm start" (dev server). Use a separate Supabase DEV project here.
# - .env.production.local  → used by "pnpm run build" / deploy. Use your PRODUCTION Supabase project here.
# Both are gitignored. Copy this file to each and fill in the right project's values.
#
# One project (simpler): copy to .env.local; dev and build will both use it.

# Supabase: Settings > API in your project dashboard
